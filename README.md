# some-projects-I-have-done
Some of the small projects I have worked on include satellite navigation, optimization algorithms, mathematical modeling, machine learning, financial engineering, and more. By taking over some small projects, I will improve my programming, professional skills, and set up a small team, I hope to receive various projects in the form of a team in the future.
